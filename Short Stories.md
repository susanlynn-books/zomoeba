    <h2>The Zomoeba Story</h2>
    <p>
      When a desperate experiment to save a child’s life unleashes a hybrid organism that rewrites human biology,
      a handful of survivors must decide how far they’re willing to go to stop what they started—and what it means
      when the cure changes more than the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zomoeba series blends grounded biology, outbreak tension, and character-driven evolution across decades:
      from the first infection at Cooper Hospital in Camden to post-collapse communities struggling to rebuild—and
      the next step in human consciousness.

    <h2>Other Books - The Out of Body Club</h2>
    <p>
     The Out of Body Club follows cognitive psychology professor Eden Thorne, whose spontaneous out-of-body experiences open a doorway into the Liminal—a hidden landscape shaped by consciousness. What begins as a terrifying anomaly becomes a dangerous discovery when she learns that someone is hunting travelers like her. As Eden uncovers a covert research group weaponizing the mind itself, she must navigate shifting realities, protect those she cares about, and confront the possibility that the most dangerous threats are the ones that can reach her outside her body.
