<p>“Resonancequake” – A speculative short story published in the Flame Tree Fiction Newsletter (September 2025). 
  In a future where lunar research and the subtle fields of cognition intersect, a scientist named Solin detects 
  an unexplained resonance beneath the Moon’s surface. What begins as a curious anomaly leads her to uncover a 
  hidden vault—its sealed contents hinting at preserved children and forgotten experiments that could reshape 
  everything humanity thought it knew about evolution and connection. Dive into this atmospheric blend of 
  science, memory, and discovery.

<p>Years after the Zomoeba outbreak is contained and a cure is released across the world, humanity is still rebuilding.
The immediate crisis has passed, but the cost was higher than anyone imagined. In a small post-collapse community
centered on Ivy Place in southern New Jersey, a new generation is coming of age—children born in the wake of
Zomoeba and the cure.</P>

<p>Some of them—formally classified by scientists as Homo zomoebis but known everywhere else simply as Cognos—aren’t quite like the others. Cade Stockton and other Cognos children show heightened pattern recognition, unusual neurological sensitivity, and the ability to “resonate” with one another in ways science can’t yet explain. While their families try to protect them, governments, corporations, and religious leaders argue over what they represent: a threat, a miracle, or the first step in a new branch of humanity.</p>

<p>As anti-Cognos rhetoric spreads and registration laws tighten, secret research programs and corporate interests move
in the shadows, determined to weaponize what Zomoeba and its cure have created. Cade, Dante, Rose, and their allies
must navigate a world where survival depends not only on physical safety, but on who controls the story of what they
are.</P>

<p>The final book in the trilogy pushes the legacy of Zomoeba beyond Earth.</P>

<p>Decades after the first outbreak in Camden, Zomoeba’s echoes reach the stars. Off-world settlements and experimental
terraforming projects on Mars begin to react to the same biological principles that once reshaped human neurology on
Earth. As Cognos children come into their full abilities, they find themselves entangled not only with each other,
but with emerging biological AIs built on the same logic that once drove Zomoeba to adapt and survive.</P>

<p>On Earth, political movements and corporate remnants struggle to either control or eradicate the Cognos, fearing what
a distributed, empathic intelligence could mean for old systems of power. On Mars, Dante and others discover that the
line between pathogen, human, and machine is thinner than anyone expected—and that some of the choices made long ago
on Earth are still rippling outward.</P>

<p>As crises on two worlds converge, Cade, Dante, Faith, and their families must decide whether Zomoeba’s legacy will
end in domination, collapse, or a hard-won, fragile kind of ascension that allows humanity and its evolved
descendants to move forward together.</P>

</div>


<p>A contemporary speculative thriller about a cognitive psychology professor whose
spontaneous out-of-body experiences drag her into a hidden network of travelers, mercenaries, and research
institutes competing to weaponize consciousness itself. Rooted in real-world OBE accounts and psychological
research, it blends grounded metaphysical speculation with escalating suspense.</p>

<p>Leaving your body is easy. Getting back is the hard part.</P>
