<p>“Resonancequake” – A speculative short story published in the Flame Tree Fiction Newsletter (September 2025). 
  In a future where lunar research and the subtle fields of cognition intersect, a scientist named Solin detects 
  an unexplained resonance beneath the Moon’s surface. What begins as a curious anomaly leads her to uncover a 
  hidden vault—its sealed contents hinting at preserved children and forgotten experiments that could reshape 
  everything humanity thought it knew about evolution and connection. Dive into this atmospheric blend of 
  science, memory, and discovery.

<p>Red Dust, Old Echoes by Susan Lynn

I am a reader of dust. Time dust, to be exact.

On Earth, that made me useful. On Mars, it made me essential.

The dust here is older than language.

They warned me before the launch that Mars would be different. That its regolith wasn’t like terrestrial dust. No pollen, no skin cells, no familiar human residue to anchor memory. They told me there was probably nothing to read at all. That this was a symbolic mission more than a practical one.

But they still sent me.

Because after Zomoeba, the pathogen and its cure that altered the human brain, humanity learned the hard way that absence can lie.

My ability surfaced before I was even walking. I’d crawl across the floor and freeze, palms flat, eyes unfocused, reacting to moments that weren’t mine. My mother used to say I stared like I was listening to ghosts trapped under the tiles. Doctors blamed residual neural permeability from the cure. Another odd echo in a generation full of them.

Most people who changed after Zomoeba gained filters. Enhanced focus. Pattern recognition. Emotional resonance.

I lost filters.

Dust remembers. Not metaphorically. Literally. After the cure, time stopped flowing cleanly around us. It began shedding—microscopic fragments of lived moments settling into particulate matter. On Earth, dust is saturated with us. Every footstep leaves a trace. Even our breath settles into it.

Touch dust, and I don’t see images. I enter moments. That’s why they stopped letting me work crime scenes years ago. Too many breakdowns. You can’t un-feel trauma once your nervous system has lived it.

Mars, they thought, would be empty enough to be safe.

The base sits on the edge of Valles Marineris, carved into rock like a wound that never healed. Outside the habitat dome, the red dust stretches unbroken to the horizon, fine as powdered bone. No windstorms today. Just silence and the low hum of life-support systems.

I kneel on the regolith.

Protocol says gloves at all times. Triple-layered, insulated, resonance-dampened. But gloves blur detail. And if there is anything here, I’ll miss it.

I peel back the dampening layer. The dust feels colder than I expect. Not cold like ice—cold like distance. Like something that hasn’t been touched in a very long time.

I press my palm down. At first, there’s nothing. No voices. No panic. No emotional surge. Just stillness so complete it almost feels aggressive. I start to pull back, embarrassed by my own hope.

Then…

A ripple.

Not human.

The sensation isn’t pain or fear. It’s coordination. Movement with intent. The dust beneath my hand doesn’t scream the way Earth dust does.

I gasp as shapes bloom in my mind—beyond sight or sound. More like spatial awareness. I feel structures where no structures remain. Cavities in the rock that were once deliberate. Smooth walls. Intersections. A sense of passage.

Someone—something—walked here.

My breath fogs the inside of my helmet as I jerk my hand away. My heart is racing, as if the planet’s weak gravity can’t keep it anchored. Training kicks in. Breathe. Anchor. Count.

But the dust doesn’t let go. It never does.

I rock back, then pitch forward again, compelled despite myself. My fingers tremble as I reach out, this time slower, more deliberate. When I touch the dust again, the past opens wider.

They were not tall.

That’s the first clear understanding. Compact bodies, close to the ground. Efficient. Built for lower gravity than Earth’s, but higher than Mars’ current pull. The dust holds impressions of motion—communal, patterned. No chaos. No fear.

Purpose.

I feel gatherings. Clusters, not crowds. Beings arranged around something central. Light, maybe. Or heat. A rhythm pulses through the memory, not sound but repetition. Work cycles. Rest cycles. Something like care.

This isn’t a civilization like ours. It’s older. And it ended quietly.

The moment that stops me isn’t collapse or disaster. It’s abandonment. The dust holds the echo of a decision made slowly, reluctantly. Leaving structures behind. Sealing passages. Withdrawing deliberately.

I pull back hard enough that I fall, landing on my side. The impact sends a plume of dust into the air, and with it comes the final impression. They knew we were coming.

Not us specifically. But someone. Life, eventually.

The dust hums with it. A patience so vast it feels like sorrow.

Mission control is shouting in my ear now. I must have triggered biometric alerts. My heart rate is spiking. Neural activity off the charts.

“Dr. Hale, disengage. Repeat, disengage.”

I don’t answer because the dust is still speaking. It shows me their last act—not a monument, not a warning. A thinning. They reduced themselves, layer by layer, until only memory remained. Time dust, seeded deliberately, woven into the planet’s skin.

A record not meant to be read quickly. Only by someone broken enough to feel it.

I finally force myself to stand. My hands are coated red, the dust clinging like it recognizes me now. I know, with absolute certainty, that if I touch it again without protection, I may not come back.

Mars doesn’t want witnesses. It wants readers.

Back inside the habitat, I scrub my hands, but the sensation lingers. My report sits unfinished on the console. Mission control wants confirmation. Evidence. Proof.

Did an ancient civilization exist on Mars?

Yes. But not the way they’re asking.

I file a partial truth. Geological anomalies. Unexplained structural voids. No definitive signs of intelligent life.

They accept it with disappointment thinly veiled as professionalism.

That night, alone in my bunk, I dream of red corridors and patient beings who learned how to turn themselves into dust so the universe would remember them properly.

I understand now why Earth dust screams and Mars dust hums. Earth never learned how to let go. Mars did. And one day, long after we’re gone, someone else will kneel here, touch the dust, and feel us too.

Because dust doesn’t care who you are.

It only cares that you were here.</P>

</div>

<p>The final book in the trilogy pushes the legacy of Zomoeba beyond Earth.</P>

<p>Decades after the first outbreak in Camden, Zomoeba’s echoes reach the stars. Off-world settlements and experimental
terraforming projects on Mars begin to react to the same biological principles that once reshaped human neurology on
Earth. As Cognos children come into their full abilities, they find themselves entangled not only with each other,
but with emerging biological AIs built on the same logic that once drove Zomoeba to adapt and survive.</P>

<p>On Earth, political movements and corporate remnants struggle to either control or eradicate the Cognos, fearing what
a distributed, empathic intelligence could mean for old systems of power. On Mars, Dante and others discover that the
line between pathogen, human, and machine is thinner than anyone expected—and that some of the choices made long ago
on Earth are still rippling outward.</P>

<p>As crises on two worlds converge, Cade, Dante, Faith, and their families must decide whether Zomoeba’s legacy will
end in domination, collapse, or a hard-won, fragile kind of ascension that allows humanity and its evolved
descendants to move forward together.</P>

</div>


<p>A contemporary speculative thriller about a cognitive psychology professor whose
spontaneous out-of-body experiences drag her into a hidden network of travelers, mercenaries, and research
institutes competing to weaponize consciousness itself. Rooted in real-world OBE accounts and psychological
research, it blends grounded metaphysical speculation with escalating suspense.</p>

<p>Leaving your body is easy. Getting back is the hard part.</P>
