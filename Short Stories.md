       A speculative short story published in the Flame Tree Fiction Newsletter (September 2025). In a future where lunar research and the subtle fields of cognition intersect, a scientist named Solin detects an unexplained resonance beneath the Moon’s surface. What begins as a curious anomaly leads her to uncover a hidden vault—its sealed contents hinting at preserved children and forgotten experiments that could reshape everything humanity thought it knew about evolution and connection. Dive into this atmospheric blend of science, memory, and discovery. Click the link below to read the story in the newsletter.

    <h2>Red Dust, Old Echos</h2>

     The Out of Body Club follows cognitive psychology professor Eden Thorne, whose spontaneous out-of-body experiences open a doorway into the Liminal—a hidden landscape shaped by consciousness. What begins as a terrifying anomaly becomes a dangerous discovery when she learns that someone is hunting travelers like her. As Eden uncovers a covert research group weaponizing the mind itself, she must navigate shifting realities, protect those she cares about, and confront the possibility that the most dangerous threats are the ones that can reach her outside her body.
