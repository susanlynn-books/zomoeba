       A speculative short story published in the Flame Tree Fiction Newsletter (September 2025). In a future where lunar research and the subtle fields of cognition intersect, a scientist named Solin detects an unexplained resonance beneath the Moon’s surface. What begins as a curious anomaly leads her to uncover a hidden vault—its sealed contents hinting at preserved children and forgotten experiments that could reshape everything humanity thought it knew about evolution and connection. Dive into this atmospheric blend of science, memory, and discovery. Click the link below to read the story in the newsletter.

    <h2>Red Dust, Old Echos</h2>
    
<p>I am a reader of dust. Time dust, to be exact.</p>

<p>On Earth, that made me useful. On Mars, it made me essential.</p>

<p>The dust here is older than language.</p>

<p>They warned me before the launch that Mars would be different. That its regolith wasn’t like terrestrial dust. No pollen, no skin cells, no familiar human residue to anchor memory. They told me there was probably nothing to read at all. That this was a symbolic mission more than a practical one.</p>

<p>But they still sent me.</p>

<p>Because after Zomoeba, the pathogen and its cure that altered the human brain, humanity learned the hard way that absence can lie.</p>

<p>My ability surfaced before I was even walking. I’d crawl across the floor and freeze, palms flat, eyes unfocused, reacting to moments that weren’t mine. My mother used to say I stared like I was listening to ghosts trapped under the tiles. Doctors blamed residual neural permeability from the cure. Another odd echo in a generation full of them.</p>

<p>Most people who changed after Zomoeba gained filters. Enhanced focus. Pattern recognition. Emotional resonance.</p>

<p>I lost filters.</p>

<p>Dust remembers. Not metaphorically. Literally. After the cure, time stopped flowing cleanly around us. It began shedding—microscopic fragments of lived moments settling into particulate matter. On Earth, dust is saturated with us. Every footstep leaves a trace. Even our breath settles into it.</p>

<p>Touch dust, and I don’t see images. I enter moments. That’s why they stopped letting me work crime scenes years ago. Too many breakdowns. You can’t un-feel <p>trauma once your nervous system has lived it.</p>

<p>Mars, they thought, would be empty enough to be safe.</p>

<p>The base sits on the edge of Valles Marineris, carved into rock like a wound that never healed. Outside the habitat dome, the red dust stretches unbroken to the horizon, fine as powdered bone. No windstorms today. Just silence and the low hum of life-support systems.</p>

<p>I kneel on the regolith.</p>

<p>Protocol says gloves at all times. Triple-layered, insulated, resonance-dampened. But gloves blur detail. And if there is anything here, I’ll miss it.</p>

<p>I peel back the dampening layer. The dust feels colder than I expect. Not cold like ice—cold like distance. Like something that hasn’t been touched in a very long time.</p>

<p>I press my palm down. At first, there’s nothing. No voices. No panic. No emotional surge. Just stillness so complete it almost feels aggressive. I start to pull back, embarrassed by my own hope.</p>

<p>Then…</p>

<p>A ripple.</p>

<p>Not human.</p>

<p>The sensation isn’t pain or fear. It’s coordination. Movement with intent. The dust beneath my hand doesn’t scream the way Earth dust does.</p>

<p>I gasp as shapes bloom in my mind—beyond sight or sound. More like spatial awareness. I feel structures where no structures remain. Cavities in the rock that were once deliberate. Smooth walls. Intersections. A sense of passage.</p>

<p>Someone—something—walked here.</p>

<p>My breath fogs the inside of my helmet as I jerk my hand away. My heart is racing, as if the planet’s weak gravity can’t keep it anchored. Training kicks in. Breathe. Anchor. Count.</p>

<p>But the dust doesn’t let go. It never does.</p>

<p>I rock back, then pitch forward again, compelled despite myself. My fingers tremble as I reach out, this time slower, more deliberate. When I touch the dust again, the past opens wider.</p>

<p>They were not tall.</p>

<p>That’s the first clear understanding. Compact bodies, close to the ground. Efficient. Built for lower gravity than Earth’s, but higher than Mars’ current pull. The dust holds impressions of motion—communal, patterned. No chaos. No fear.</p>

<p>Purpose.</p>

<p>I feel gatherings. Clusters, not crowds. Beings arranged around something central. Light, maybe. Or heat. A rhythm pulses through the memory, not sound but repetition. Work cycles. Rest cycles. Something like care.</p>

<p>This isn’t a civilization like ours. It’s older. And it ended quietly.</p>

<p>The moment that stops me isn’t collapse or disaster. It’s abandonment. The dust holds the echo of a decision made slowly, reluctantly. Leaving structures behind. Sealing passages. Withdrawing deliberately.</p>

<p>I pull back hard enough that I fall, landing on my side. The impact sends a plume of dust into the air, and with it comes the final impression. They knew we were coming.</p>

<p>Not us specifically. But someone. Life, eventually.</p>

<p>The dust hums with it. A patience so vast it feels like sorrow.</p>

<p>Mission control is shouting in my ear now. I must have triggered biometric alerts. My heart rate is spiking. Neural activity off the charts.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hale, disengage. Repeat, disengage.”</p>

<p>I don’t answer because the dust is still speaking. It shows me their last act—not a monument, not a warning. A thinning. They reduced themselves, layer by layer, until only memory remained. Time dust, seeded deliberately, woven into the planet’s skin.</p>

<p>A record not meant to be read quickly. Only by someone broken enough to feel it.</p>

<p>I finally force myself to stand. My hands are coated red, the dust clinging like it recognizes me now. I know, with absolute certainty, that if I touch it again without protection, I may not come back.</p>

<p>Mars doesn’t want witnesses. It wants readers.</p>

<p>Back inside the habitat, I scrub my hands, but the sensation lingers. My report sits unfinished on the console. Mission control wants confirmation. Evidence. Proof.</p>

<p>Did an ancient civilization exist on Mars?</p>

<p>Yes. But not the way they’re asking.</p>

<p>I file a partial truth. Geological anomalies. Unexplained structural voids. No definitive signs of intelligent life.</p>

<p>They accept it with disappointment thinly veiled as professionalism.</p>

<p>That night, alone in my bunk, I dream of red corridors and patient beings who learned how to turn themselves into dust so the universe would remember them properly.</p>

<p>I understand now why Earth dust screams and Mars dust hums. Earth never learned how to let go. Mars did. And one day, long after we’re gone, someone else will kneel here, touch the dust, and feel us too.</p>

<p>Because dust doesn’t care who you are.</p>

<p>It only cares that you were here.</p>
