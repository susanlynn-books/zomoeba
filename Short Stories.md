</div>

<p>When microbiologist Dr. David Hoover’s son contracts a rare, brain-eating amoeba, he makes a desperate choice:
repurpose his Alzheimer’s research to engineer a neuro-regenerative organism. The result—Zomoeba—doesn’t just
heal brain tissue; it integrates with it, creating a resilient, predatory hybrid life form.</p>

<p>When twenty-year-old Emily Rogers is infected after swimming in a southern New Jersey Creek, Hoover sees his chance
and secretly uses her as his first human test subject. Emily wakes, even speaks—but what’s animating her isn’t
recovery. Inside Cooper Hospital in Camden, the infection jumps from room to room through blood and bites, turning
patients and staff into “remnants”—driven, mobile, and no longer fully human.</P>

<p>As the hospital and surrounding riverfront towns collapse into chaos, Hoover’s wife Elizabeth, nurse Alicia Reyes,
and a handful of survivors must fight their way out and decide how far they’re willing to go to stop what he
started. Any cure they create may also alter the future of human evolution—and not everyone wants that future to be
stopped.</P>

<p>Years after the Zomoeba outbreak is contained and a cure is released across the world, humanity is still rebuilding.
The immediate crisis has passed, but the cost was higher than anyone imagined. In a small post-collapse community
centered on Ivy Place in southern New Jersey, a new generation is coming of age—children born in the wake of
Zomoeba and the cure.</P>

<p>Some of them—formally classified by scientists as Homo zomoebis but known everywhere else simply as Cognos—aren’t quite like the others. Cade Stockton and other Cognos children show heightened pattern recognition, unusual neurological sensitivity, and the ability to “resonate” with one another in ways science can’t yet explain. While their families try to protect them, governments, corporations, and religious leaders argue over what they represent: a threat, a miracle, or the first step in a new branch of humanity.</p>

<p>As anti-Cognos rhetoric spreads and registration laws tighten, secret research programs and corporate interests move
in the shadows, determined to weaponize what Zomoeba and its cure have created. Cade, Dante, Rose, and their allies
must navigate a world where survival depends not only on physical safety, but on who controls the story of what they
are.</P>

<p>The final book in the trilogy pushes the legacy of Zomoeba beyond Earth.</P>

<p>Decades after the first outbreak in Camden, Zomoeba’s echoes reach the stars. Off-world settlements and experimental
terraforming projects on Mars begin to react to the same biological principles that once reshaped human neurology on
Earth. As Cognos children come into their full abilities, they find themselves entangled not only with each other,
but with emerging biological AIs built on the same logic that once drove Zomoeba to adapt and survive.</P>

<p>On Earth, political movements and corporate remnants struggle to either control or eradicate the Cognos, fearing what
a distributed, empathic intelligence could mean for old systems of power. On Mars, Dante and others discover that the
line between pathogen, human, and machine is thinner than anyone expected—and that some of the choices made long ago
on Earth are still rippling outward.</P>

<p>As crises on two worlds converge, Cade, Dante, Faith, and their families must decide whether Zomoeba’s legacy will
end in domination, collapse, or a hard-won, fragile kind of ascension that allows humanity and its evolved
descendants to move forward together.</P>

</div>


<p>A contemporary speculative thriller about a cognitive psychology professor whose
spontaneous out-of-body experiences drag her into a hidden network of travelers, mercenaries, and research
institutes competing to weaponize consciousness itself. Rooted in real-world OBE accounts and psychological
research, it blends grounded metaphysical speculation with escalating suspense.</p>

<p>Leaving your body is easy. Getting back is the hard part.</P>
