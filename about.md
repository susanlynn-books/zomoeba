    <h2>About Susan Lynn </h2>

    <p>Susan Lynn is a speculative fiction writer whose work blends science, empathy, and curiosity about the future. Her stories examine evolution—biological, technological, and perceptual—and the quiet moments where change begins. She is the author of the Zomoëba trilogy and The Out of Body Club.</p>
    
<p>She grew up—and still lives—in a small riverfront town near where the Zomoëba Trilogy takes place. A former IT professional and nonprofit director, she first discovered her love of writing through grant proposals (because what’s more thrilling than justifying a budget in under 500 words?).
   </p>

<p>Inspired by her mother’s fascination with science and nature, she blended that curiosity with a lifelong love of speculative and medical thrillers. "Zomoëba: The Price of Playing God," her debut noval, began with a single question: What if the environment shifted just enough to let something dangerous slip through?
   </p>

<p>When she’s not writing, Susan enjoys time with her children and grandchildren—quietly passing on the same wonder she once learned.
