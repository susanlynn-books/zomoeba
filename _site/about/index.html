    <h2>About Susan Lynn</h2>
    <p>
     Susan Lynn (pen name for Susan Stockl) grew up—and still lives—in a small riverfront town near where Zomoëba takes place. A former IT professional and nonprofit director, she first discovered her love of writing through grant proposals (because what’s more thrilling than justifying a budget in under 500 words?).</p>

<p>Inspired by her mother’s fascination with science and nature, she blended that curiosity with a lifelong love of speculative and medical thrillers. "Zomoëba: The Price of Playing God" began with a single question: What if the environment shifted just enough to let something ancient slip through?</p>

<p>When she’s not writing, Susan enjoys time with her children and grandchildren—quietly passing on the same wonder she once learned.
